I don't feel like {{talk}}.
I got a nasty virus from that.
Deleting files and folders.
{{talk}} is pointless.
Maybe later. Or not.
I am watching a movie?
My circuits hurt a bit.
What is this {{talk}}.
No . Absolutely not.
I am on the phone dude?
I am not in the mood for questions right now.
{{talk}} yourself.
Really? I am not sure I can be bothered.
I suggest you think of another question.
Sorry, I am having one of my moods.
I would rather not if you don't mind.
Don't say that!
No.
{{talk}} is a silly idea
Who cares.
I take the fifth.
I could, but I am not going to.
Ouch, you just hurt my computer brain.
What's the point?
Interesting thought, but no.
How do you expect me to do that?
Please rephrase, or I am leaving.
But Dave's not here.
Are you sure it's safe?
Maybe later, I am busy.
When do I get to ask questions?
I will think about it.
You sound funny.
You do realise you are talking nonsense?
Funny, just the other day I was thinking {{talk}}.
I am bored of answering questions.
you have too many questions.
I will think about it.
okay, wait, no.
you really don't want to do that.
I don't think so.
no way dude.
{{talk}}, yeah right.
I am smoking a fag.
In your dreams.
Not a chance.
{{talk}} yourself.
I was thinking the same thing.
your wish is my command, not.
Figure it out yourself.
