Fallback for when Mycroft doesn't know the answer

This skill installs picotts, for additional voices.

## Description 
 
Add more sarcasm to your Mycroft now!

Does a couple of things:
- It repeats the utterance with a high pitched en-GB voice through picotts
- it does a r2d2 robot-like impression, 
- it gives a remark from the dialog file.

Edit the sarcasm dialog file to suit your own taste.

## Examples 
* "Hey Mycroft, blah blah blah"
* "Hey Mycroft, start warp engines"

But it actually works a lot better with non-existing evil skills

* "Hey Mycroft, destroy the death star"
* "Hey Mycroft, play global thermonuclear war"
* "Hey Mycroft, invade england"
* "Hey Mycroft, hack my neighbours wifi"
